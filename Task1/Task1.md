# Task 1 #

## Story ##
Use skills you have learned up to this point to create a small Java application that given an integer between 0 and 5 it prints the English word for that number.
Skills to be used:
* GitHub
* Java
* Variables
* Types
* Conditions
* Java System class
* Windows Command Line
	
### Task 1.1 ###
Connect to GitHub and perform a pull request.
Covers a few steps that you may just be getting familiar with so I will go a little more in-depth.
* Hit Windows Key + R
  * This should open the run window
  * Type CMD
    * This should open the Windows Command Prompt (Console window)
    * Below I will be giving you a few commands to call. I will use the following format when I want you to type a command at the Windows Command Prompt.
    * Command Prompt: <The Command here>
* Change directory to C:\
  * Command Prompt: cd C:\
  * Changes directory to the root of your C: drive
* Create a directory at that location called work
  * Command Prompt: mkdir work
  * This should create a new directory on the C: drive
* Change directory into C:\work
  * Command Prompt: cd work
* Now clone the following repository from github
  * These step assumes you have made it through a few videos in the GitHub training and have created an account and downloaded the git tools found at the following link: https://git-scm.com/downloads
  * Command Prompt: git clone https://github.com/kery00/Training.git
  * This should create a folder under work called training
* Change directory in to training
  * Command Prompt: CD training\Task1
* Open Task1.md and continue to Task 1.2
  * Command Prompt: notepad.exe Task1.md
### Task 1.2 ###
Create a Java application that adds 2 integers and converts the integers and result to string representation. Call it IntToString
* Create a new Java file in the Task 1 folder
* Requirements:
  * Takes integers between 0 and 5.
  * Adds the two integers.
  * Print a equation to screen along with results.
    * Example 1 would be One, 2 would be Two.
* When done meeting requirements Commit that source to Github under Task 1 Folder.
  * Command Prompt: git commit -a -m "Task 1.2 Complete"
  * Command Prompt: git push

### Task 1.3 ###
Modify IntToString to handle values outside of specified Range
* Requirements:
  * Handle numbers that are not in the range by printing a Friendly Message. 
* Commit changes to source control.
  * Command Prompt: git commit -a -m "Task 1.4 Complete"
  * Command Prompt: git push
